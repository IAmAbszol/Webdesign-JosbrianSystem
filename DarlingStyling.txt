Quick reference for anyone trying to use code I've built and aren't quite sure how to find them.

My naming conventions for HMTL are usually
componentname followed by parent name then action

Example is
<div id="alertboxitemsearch" class="alert alert-danger fade in" style ="display: none; color: black; white-space: pre-wrap;">

</div>

Where:
componentname=alertbox
parent=item since were in the items tab
action=search
